## Description 
With all of the tweets circulating every second it is hard to tell whether the sentiment behind a specific tweet will impact a company, or a person's, brand for being viral (positive), or devastate profit because it strikes a negative tone. Capturing sentiment in language is important in these times where decisions and reactions are created and updated in seconds. But, which words actually lead to the sentiment description? In this competition you will need to pick out the part of the tweet (word or phrase) that reflects the sentiment.
The project consists in developing a model for the extraction of feelings, competition rules and datasets used in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction
## Data 
the uploaded data contains csv files of train dataset, test dataset and the submission file

## Generate Model
### requirements
For installing requirements : pip install requirements.txt
### first model
- The file used for training and generate model is Main_first_model.ipynb
- generated model is model1.hdf5
### second model
this model is based on RoBERTa pretrained model: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach by Yinhan Liu, Myle Ott, Naman Goyal, Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, Omer Levy, Mike Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer, Veselin Stoyanov. It is based on Googleâ€™s BERT model released in 2018.
